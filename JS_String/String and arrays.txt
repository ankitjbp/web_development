String => text that used for various purposes, 
such as show/display name, address values etc. 
String can operated in various terms 





Array => In general when we deal similar sort of items together, 
or keep together in linear/ sequential order, its call array.
Location of each element is called 'index'


example -> students of a class

student = ['Rahul','Mohit','Naveen','Dwarika']
here student is an array, which have four elements.

to access any  element/item we need to write array's name and add 
square bracket, and put index of our required item. 
and indexing begin with zero 0, instead of 1 

For example, in this array  to access 'Mohit' we need to access student[1]
